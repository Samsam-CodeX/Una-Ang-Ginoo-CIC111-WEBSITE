                    LUX MUNDIS IN ACTION: A HEART FOR THE FIRE VICTIMS OF MANTIC
                </h4>
                <P>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A little act of kindness from our fellow Lux Mundis, the compassionate students, faculty and staff of Tangub City 
                    Global College who, along with the generous hearts of other donors, came together to extend help and hope to the 
                    victims of the recent fire in Mantic, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental.<br><br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Through a collective effort rooted in empathy 
                    and solidarity, various donations were gathered and turned over to the affected families. These were thoughtfully 
                    distributed by the Supreme Student Council of Tangub City Global College, who served not just as student leaders, 
                    but as instruments of service and compassion in this time of need.<br><br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To everyone who contributed in any way, whether through goods, time, or prayers. your kindness has made a difference. 
                    May this gesture remind us all that no act of kindness is ever too small, and that in unity, we can spark light even in the darkest of times.
                </P>
