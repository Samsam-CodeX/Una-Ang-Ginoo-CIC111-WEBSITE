            <h2>The Call to Be Light</h2>
            <p>The title **Lux Mundi** is a promise—a commitment to bring clarity, warmth, and ethical guidance to every sphere of life. To truly embody this spirit, we must integrate the foundational values instilled by TCGC College into our daily habits and interactions. This guide offers practical steps to make these values shine.</p>

            <h2>Putting TCGC Core Values Into Action</h2>
            <p>Our three core values are not just statements; they are action guides. Here is how we apply them to shine brightly:</p>

            <div class="value-block">
                <h3>Core Value 1: Integrity</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The adherence to moral and ethical principles; the state of being whole and undivided in character.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Own Your Mistakes:</strong> When something goes wrong, immediately take responsibility. Integrity means admitting fault and focusing on repair, not denial.</li>
                    <li><strong>Uphold Academic Honesty:</strong> Always cite your sources, never plagiarize, and complete tests and assignments based solely on your own work. Your diploma should reflect your true effort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow Through:</strong> Do what you said you would do, even when it’s inconvenient or no one is watching. Your private actions must align with your public promises.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="value-block">
                <h3>Core Value 2: Compassion</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others, combined with a desire to help.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Listen Actively:</strong> When a classmate or peer shares a struggle, put away distractions and listen without interrupting or preparing your own response. Empathy begins with attention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice Online Kindness:</strong> Avoid harsh criticism, ridicule, or dismissive comments in social media or group chats. Assume the best intent and respond with patience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be an Inclusive Presence:</strong> Actively seek out those who are marginalized or quiet. A truly compassionate environment ensures that everyone feels seen and valued.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="value-block">
                <h3>Core Value 3: Excellence</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The quality of being outstanding or extremely good; striving for the highest possible standards in all endeavors.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Effort, Not Just Grade:</strong> Excellence is the continuous commitment to giving your best effort in every subject and project, regardless of the difficulty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Embrace Constructive Criticism:</strong> View feedback from instructors and peers as a tool for growth, not a personal attack. Use it to continuously refine your skills and character.</li>
                    <li><strong>Go Beyond the Minimum:</strong> Look for opportunities to enhance your learning, whether through extra reading, joining academic clubs, or mentoring others. A light that grows brighter through constant learning.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Sustaining the Light</h2>
