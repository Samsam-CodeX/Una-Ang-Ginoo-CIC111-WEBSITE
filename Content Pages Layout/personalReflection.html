            <h2>I. Faith</h2>
            <p id="verse">
                <i>“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” - <b>Philippians 4:13</b></i><br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                My faith is my strength when life feels impossible. When I say "I can do all things," it is a promise 
                rooted in Christ, meaning I have the power for the next hard step, relying not on my own willpower, 
                but on the feeling of being completely supported by God. I know I don't have to carry the whole heavy 
                load alone. This quiet certainty lets me face confusing moments, trusting that the strength I need will 
                always show up when I need it most. It is the reliable reason I keep moving forward.
            </p>

            <h2>II. Integrity</h2>
            <p>
                This strength I find in my faith is what empowers me to live with integrity. For me, integrity means 
                the daily, consistent commitment to aligning my actions with my beliefs, even when no one is watching. 
                As a student, this requires choosing honest effort in academics over shortcuts and being reliable to my 
                friends. My reflection is simple: Am I taking the easy way, or the honest way? I strive to use my faith 
                to ensure my decisions build a solid foundation of trust and respect every day.

            <h2>III. Responsible Digital Citizenship</h2>
            <p>
                Because I must be consistent, I treat the internet just like my real-world community. 
                Being a good digital citizen means my faith and integrity rules still apply online. Every single 
                post, comment, or picture I share affects real people. So, I promise to use technology to build others up and 
                to learn, not to hurt or spread bad feelings. My biggest test of integrity online is pausing to practice 
                empathy before I hit 'send,' making sure my actions reflect the honest, positive person I aim to be.
