                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hello, my name is <b>Andrew Sambulan</b>, the developer of this website. I am really passionate
                about coding, making the things that only exist in my mind. Most especially, I really like making games and developing stuffs
                the reason why I pursued BSCS.

                        I am a consistent honor student in Silangit National High School and have taken GAS track
                        during my Senior High School. Although this is somewhat far from my passion of coding, I still
                        studied coding separate from school and have to do it myself

                        During this time I still have no idea that in the future programming
                        will be my passion.

                        This is a platformer game, one of my very first projects. I have stopped coding this because
                        there are other things that needs to be done first, especially school. But still I decided to feature it here. 
                        Just click on Mario to play and use the key A, W, and D to move.

                        This is the MOST accurate Number to Text Converter personally coded by myself.
                        I was coding this project during free time between classes. I made this thing beacuse of a coding
                        challenge with my classmate. This program supports very large numbers and inlcuding decimals as well
